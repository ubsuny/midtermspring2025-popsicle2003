    "For this problem, we start by assessing the mechanics we used for a triatomic molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Triatomic molecules\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will look at a model of a linear triatomic molecule with one central mass $M$ attached to two peripheral masses $m$. If the molecule is linear, we can approximate this as three masses attached by two springs of constants $k_{12}$ and $k_{23}$. \n",

    "-  $K$ is the stiffness (or force‐constant) matrix constructed from the ideal springs connecting adjacent atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the peripheral (oxygen) mass as $M$ and the carbon mass as $m$ (in atomic mass units). For the bond (spring) force constants we assume that the O–C bonds are stiffer than the C–C bonds—so we set the O–C constant to $K$ and the C-C constant to $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Eigenfrequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the natural frequencies at which molecules vibrate when they are slightly disturbed from their configurations. They are solved through the generalized eigenvalue problem given above. Each eigenfrequency represents one of the distinct rates at which the system naturally oscillates. They depend on both the masses of the atoms (inertia) and the bond stiffness (restoring forces). For instance, a high eigenfrequency indicates a mode where the bonds are very stiff (or the masses are lighter), leading to rapid oscillations; a low eigenfrequency corresponds to a softer bond or heavier masses. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are Normal Modes\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal mode is a characteristic pattern of motion in which all parts of the system oscillate at the same eigenfrequency and with fixed relative phases. They are “normal” in the sense that the modes are decoupled; exciting one mode does not induce oscillation in another."

    "Our output tells us of it's vibrational fingerprint. Our Eigenfrequencies reveal a miniscule translational mode, while the other four reveal internal vibrational modes. Lower frequencies (like 5.47 rad/s) generally indicate softer, collective motions, while higher ones (18–19 rad/s) are associated with stiffer bonds. For our values here, we are only taking up to four significant figures. For our normal modes, we see there is a uniform mode, where all values are uniform (-0.4472), representing the translational mode. In this mode, every atom shifts by the same amount in the same direction, which doesn’t change the relative distances between atoms. The other modes show various patterns where some atoms move in the opposite direction to others. These are stretched/compressed modes. (We need to infer it from a top down fashion)"

    "Just like with C3O2, we have a near zero value, which corresponds to the translational mode. Lower-frequency modes (e.g. around 2.48 and 5.05 rad/s) typically involve large-scale or collective motions of the carbons with only gentle stretching. Mid-range frequencies (around 7.68 to 12.66 rad/s) represent more localized motion in the carbon chain. The highest-frequency modes (around 16.48 to 19.09 rad/s) tend to be dominated by the stiffer bonds (the O–C bonds) reaching their highest-energy stretching. Due to the shorter structure of C3O2, the lower-frequency mode is barely present, and in both, the higher frequency mode seems quite prominent. As for normal modes, the matrix shows the relative displacement of each of the 11 atoms for each vibrational mode. Because the molecule is symmetric (oxygen atoms at both ends), many of the eigenvectors display mirror symmetry: for instance, in many modes the displacements at atom 1 mirror those at atom 11 (possibly with opposite signs), and similar pairing occurs for atoms near the ends. (We need to infer it from a top down fashion)."
